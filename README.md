## What is the convex hull problem?

if you had random points given to you on a 2D space, how do we find out the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the given points. By convex polygon we mean to have a polygon whose angles between adjacent edges are acute or obtuse but not reflex angles, meaning the angles must be less than 180&deg;.
